//Source files in this program: PongLogic.cs, PongMain.cs, PonForm.cs, PongForm.Designer.cs
//Purpose of this entire program:  Emulate the atari game "Pong." A player enters
//a ball speed and the ball gets a random starting direction, when a paddle hits the ball 
//it is reversed. If the ball is missed by the player's paddle, then the other person gets
//a point. The game ends when a player accumulates 5 points.
//
//Name of this file: PongLogic.cs
//Purpose of this file: Provides a simple algorithm that gets a starting random direction.
